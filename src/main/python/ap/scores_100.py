    Description:
        Given an array of scores, return True if there are scores 
        of 100 next to each other
        in the array. The array length will be at least 2.
    
    Examples:
        scores_100([1, 100, 100]) -> True
        scores_100([1, 100, 99, 100]) -> False
        scores_100([100, 1, 100, 100]) -> True

    Args:
        scores (list[int]): A list of integer scores.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there is at least one occurrence of consecutive 100's, else False.
