def copy_evens(nums: list[int], count: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Description:
        Given an array of positive integers, return a new list containing 
        the first `count` even numbers from the original array.
        The original array will contain at least `count` even numbers.

    Examples:
        copy_evens([3, 2, 4, 5, 8], 2) -> [2, 4]
        copy_evens([3, 2, 4, 5, 8], 3) -> [2, 4, 8]
        copy_evens([6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8], 3) -> [6, 2, 4]

    Args:
        nums (list[int]): A list of positive integers.
        count (int): The number of even integers to return.

    Returns:
        list[int]: A list of the first `count` even integers from the original array.
