    Description:
        Given an array of strings, return a new array containing the first N strings.
        N will be in the range 1..length of the input array.

    Examples:
        words_front(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 1) -> ["a"]
        words_front(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2) -> ["a", "b"]
        words_front(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 3) -> ["a", "b", "c"]

    Args:
        words (List[str]): A list of strings.
        n (int): The number of strings to return from the start of the list.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list containing the first N strings from the input array.
