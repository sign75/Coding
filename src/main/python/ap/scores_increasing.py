def scores_increasing(scores: list[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Description:
        Given a list of scores (integers), return True if the scores are 
        in non-decreasing order — that is, each score is equal to or 
        greater than the one before.

    Examples:
        scores_increasing([1, 3, 4]) -> True
        scores_increasing([1, 3, 2]) -> False
        scores_increasing([1, 1, 4]) -> True

    Args:
        scores (list[int]): A list of integers, length 2 or more.

    Returns:
        bool: True if each score is equal or greater than the previous one.
