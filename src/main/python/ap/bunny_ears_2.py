def bunny_ears_2(bunnies: int) -> int:
    """
    Description:
        We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... 
        The odd bunnies (1, 3, ...) have the normal 2 ears. 
        The even bunnies (2, 4, ...) we'll say have 3 ears, because they each have a raised foot.
        Recursively return the number of "ears" in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without loops or multiplication).

    Examples:
        bunny_ears_2(0) -> 0
        bunny_ears_2(1) -> 2
        bunny_ears_2(2) -> 5

    Args:
        bunnies (int): The number of bunnies.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of ears in the bunny line.
