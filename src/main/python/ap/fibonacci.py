def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Description:
        The fibonacci sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to have a recursive definition.
        The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). Each subsequent value is the sum
        of the previous two values, so the whole sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on.
        Define a recursive fibonacci(n) method that returns the nth fibonacci number, with n=0 representing the start
        of the sequence.

    Examples:
        fibonacci(0) -> 0
        fibonacci(1) -> 1
        fibonacci(2) -> 1

    Args:
        n (int): The position in the fibonacci sequence, with fibonacci(0)=0.

    Returns:
        int: The nth fibonacci number.
