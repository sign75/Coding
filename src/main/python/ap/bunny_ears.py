def bunny_ears(bunnies: int) -> int:
    """
    Description:
        We have a number of bunnies and each bunny has two big floppy ears. 
        We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies 
        recursively (without loops or multiplication).

    Examples:
        bunny_ears(0) -> 0
        bunny_ears(1) -> 2
        bunny_ears(2) -> 4

    Args:
        bunnies (int): The number of bunnies.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of ears across all the bunnies.
