def scores_average(scores: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Description:
        Given an array of scores, compute the integer average 
        of the first half and the second half,
        and return whichever is larger. The second half begins 
        at index len(scores)//2.
        You must use a helper function that computes the average 
        of the values between two indices.

    Examples:
        scores_average([2, 2, 4, 4]) -> 4
        scores_average([4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2]) -> 4
        scores_average([3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]) -> 4

    Args:
        scores (list[int]): A list of scores (at least 2 elements long).

    Returns:
        int: The higher integer average between the first and second half of the list.

    # design the most efficient algorithm.
    
    # Case-2. If the question can be solved with 'recursion', design a 
    # correct algorithm. Since the recursion can be inefficient, use 
    # either 'tabulation' or 'memorization' to break it down into 'iteration'.
